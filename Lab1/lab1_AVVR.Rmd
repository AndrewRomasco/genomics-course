## Exercise 1
For x = 3 and y = 15, compute the sum, difference, product and quotient of x and y
```{r}
x <- 3
y <- 15
x+y
x-y
x*y
x/y
```


## Exercise 2
For x = 2 and y = 3, Test x^5 is greater than y^4 and return a logical value
```{r}
x <-2
y <-3
x^5 > y^4
```


## Exercise 3
Create a vector of the values 22, 62, 148, 43 and 129. Determine the sum of the vector. Divide each value in the vector by the sum to determine relate frequency.
```{r}
vector <- c(22, 62, 148, 43, 129)
sum <- sum(vector)
sum
freq.vector <- vector/sum
freq.vector
```


## Exercise 4
Create a vector of the nucleotides A, T, C and G. Sort the vector.
```{r}
DNA <- c('A', 'T', 'C', 'G')
sort(DNA)
DNA
```
